## ECS Container management


This tool provisions your stack on ECS clusters. We can integrate this with CI-instances or run via command-line to manage our ecs deployments. Also packaged are dockerfiles for consul-client, consul-master and registrator.

### Why use this

- Deploy an app to multiple ECS clusters 
- Scale up or down your container instances 
- Integrate with your CI environment for deployments
- Manage container lifecycle ( create, update and delete ) 



### Modes:

Script works in two different modes:


   -  Single file : Specify individual config file name and service will be updated for one single file
   
   
   -  Multiple files: Do not specify any file and any file in base directory will be processesed.
   
   

#### NOTE: Base directory is ${SCRIPT_DIR}/config/

### Prereqs:
1. An ECS cluster containing minimum one instance
2. Instances should have ECS agent along with docker running on instances
3. If a service exists, it cannot be recreated to achieve idempotency. It has to be updated using update option
4. For deploying consul-clusters, EC2 instances ( client and master ) need to have a common tag in order for consul-cluster to work
5. Please visit dockerfiles directory for more information and take a look at the sample config files. 

### Dependencies:
1. Boto3
2. Python YAML


### Tool usage:


`usage: orchestrate.py [-h] [-r REGION] [-f CONFFILE] [-c COUNT] [-v] [-e ENV] (--create | --update | --delete)`

#### NOTE: 
There are some issues with setting up autoscaling based on both CPU and Memory at a same time. Currently, We can't set AND|OR condition in service autoscaling. 
So setting up CPU and Memory based autoscaling at a same time might trigger two confliting alarms at a same time. i.e we can have a situation where one alarm would try to scalein and other would try to scaleout at a same time. 


## Arguments for managing services with ecs:


    -h, --help   show this help message and exit
    -r REGION    OPTIONAL: Region. Default is us-east-2
    -f CONFFILE  OPTIONAL: Config to pass for parsing. An individual file can be passed for one-off deployments.
    -c COUNT     OPTIONAL: Count for scaling up or down, If not specified, wil be picked from update conf file
    -v           OPTIONAL: Verbose flag
    -e ENV       OPTIONAL: Target environment [ dev,qa,stage ]. Default is dev
    --create     REQUIRED/EXCLUSIVE : Create a service from task definition
    --update     REQUIRED/EXCLUSIVE : Update a service. [ task defs, container count etc]
    --delete     REQUIRED/EXCLUSIVE : Delete a service from specified cluster

### ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Example: 
     python orchestrate.py -e dev -f config/dev/test.yaml -v --create 
     -- Will create desired services on ECS cluster printing information on console 
     python orchestrate.py -e dev -f config/dev/test.yaml -v --update
     -- Will update image for running containers
     python orchestrate.py -e dev -f config/dev/test.yaml -v -c 10 --update
     -- Will update count to 10 for containers given cluster has the capacity 
     python orchestrate.py -e dev --create 
     -- Will create services for .yaml files in config/dev directory 
    

### Example yaml:
```yaml
# Yaml formate to manage entire lifcycle of containers
# We define four stages as of now viz:
# 1. Tak registration
# 2. Service creation
# 3. Service updates
# 4. Service deletion
# Assumption:
#      - Images are available in ECR repo or docker-hub
#      - Cluster is up and running with container instances
